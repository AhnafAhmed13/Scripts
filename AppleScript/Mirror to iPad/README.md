# Mirror to iPad

I broke my macbook screen (again! ðŸ˜­). But I didn't wanna replace the screen this time. I already have a monitor at home so I don't really have a problem as long as I'm home. However, the problem starts as soon as I step outisde. I'm cooked if I don't have access to a monitor! ðŸ« 
So, I decided to DIY a temporary portable external display. I have an iPad (yes I'm locked into the ecosystem smh) so I wanted to utilize the screen mirroring feature, but without any help from my laptop's primary display, I'm blind asf! ðŸ«£
So, to make it possible to hit the bullseye while being blindfolded, I made an app with **AppleScript** using Apple's **Automator** tool that enables me to open the Control Center and navigate to the Screen Mirroring dialog. From there, since the dialog box and the options are text-based, I used the keyboard accessibility features to navigate to the correct option and select my iPad to start mirroring. I'm on **MacOS Sequioa 15.5** and it requires you to grant accessibility permission from Privacy and Security section in the System Settings.
